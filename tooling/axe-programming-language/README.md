Axe is a programming language that centred around ease of concurrency and memory safety. It is designed to be simple and easy to learn. 

It is a compiled language that is similar to C, though with a more modern and concise syntax.

def some_function() {
    println "Hello, world.";
}

def main() {
    some_function();
}
```
